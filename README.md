  One of the critical libraries of this software/application is **braille** by the user of AaditT here's the link to his braille library: https://github.com/AaditT/braille#braille---1st-place-winner-at-harkerhacks-2018, but we've figured it out later that it's unsuitable for our project so we make a new machine learning to translate braille. Another important library is CustomTkinter a new and enhanced version of Tkinter to make our user interface easier to access and edit.
